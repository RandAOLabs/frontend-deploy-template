A modern web application template built with:
- [React](https://react.dev/) - A JavaScript library for building user interfaces
- [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - JavaScript with syntax for types
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) - Next Generation Frontend Tooling
- [ArNS](https://ar.io/arns/) - The Permaweb Name System for permanent web deployment

This template provides a minimal setup to get started with React development and automated deployment to both the permaweb (via ArNS) and traditional hosting servers.

## Getting Started

For development setup instructions, please see our [Development Guide](docs/development.md).

## Deployment Options

This template supports two deployment methods, both automated via GitHub Actions:

### 1. Permaweb Deployment (Arweave/ArNS)
Deploy your application to the permanent web using Arweave's decentralized storage and ArNS for permanent, censorship-resistant hosting.

**Requirements:**
- Arweave wallet with Turbo Credits
- ArNS name ownership or controller access
- GitHub secrets: `DEPLOY_KEY`
- GitHub variables: `DEPLOY_ARNS_NAME`, `DEPLOY_UNDERNAME` (optional)

📖 [Full Permaweb Deployment Guide](docs/deployment.md)

### 2. Traditional Server Deployment (SSH/SCP)
Deploy your application to a physical server or VPS via SSH/SCP with automatic nginx reload.

**Requirements:**
- Server with SSH access
- Nginx web server
- Deploy user with proper permissions
- GitHub secrets: `SSH_PRIVATE_KEY`, `SERVER_IP`
- DNS configuration (manual, one-time)
- SSL/TLS certificate setup (manual, one-time with auto-renewal)

📖 [Full SSH Deployment Guide](docs/ssh-deployment.md)

### Deployment Triggers

Both deployments are triggered automatically on every push to the `master` branch. You can disable either workflow by deleting or disabling the respective workflow file in `.github/workflows/`.
